Hi there, I'm Atsushi 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in San Francisco 🌁, originally from Kyoto ⛩️

I currently work at [Retool](https://retool.com/) tinkering on DevX toolings.

I mainly write about systems I'm interested in or things I got stuck on recently.

Some of my interests are running 🏃‍♂️, golf 🏌️, chess ♟️, and manga 📚
