I migrated this site from Jekyll to Hugo over the course of a week during my between-jobs break!

There were a couple of issues with the previous version:
- It forked a Jekyll bootstrapper ([jekyll-now][jekyll-now]) which felt like an unnecessary layer of abstraction.
- The theme I picked back in 2016 felt cluttered, and I wanted to make it simple & text focused.
- Comments were hosted on Disqus which I don't use elsewhere.

This post goes over my experience with the migration as well as what I wish I had known before starting the process.

## Understanding Hugo concepts

Although it was easy to go from 0 to 1 with the `hugo server` command, I found the Hugo documentation unintuitive to navigate. When I'm starting out with a new tool, I first look for a broad overview of critical features. Instead, Hugo's documentation is organized into dozens of sections where each one has its own `Introduction` page to click through.

If I were to start over again, I would read Agustin Canalis's excellent [Hugo overview post][hugo-overview] as well as [this Hugo templates guide][hugo-templates] by RÃ©gis Philibert first to go beyond the "Quick start" doc quickly.

## Design

From the start I knew I wanted to go with the [Hugo bear blog theme][hugo-bear-theme], so the design was more a matter of customizing the color palette to my liking. After rolling the dice with [colors.co][colors] a bunch of times, I was satisfied with this [green / orange based palette][my-pallete]. Once I got a passing grade on [whocanuse.com][whocanuse] and checked its accessibility, the next focus was on specific CSS issues.

### Code blocks

Besides the minor issues (e.g. inline code highlight, [iOS safari text scaling][ios-safari], etc), the biggest challenge for me was handling the code overflow. When the line went beyond the initial width of the code block, it lacked a background style.

Thankfully Veriphor's ["Code block line numbers"][code-block-post] post explained how it's rendered and the solution provided worked for me.

```css
.highlight pre code {
    display: inline-block;
}

.highlight div,
.highlight > pre {
    overflow-x: auto;
}
```

For these code blocks, Hugo uses the [Chroma][chroma] syntax highlighter under the hood. Despite having many available themes, not all of them are created equal. In particular, the `github-dark` theme incorrectly highlighted code so I went with `dracula` instead which was more accurate.

## RSS feed

The previous version relied on Jekyll's default RSS feed generator, but I wanted to get a better understanding of the protocol. I first read these two posts to get an overview of how it's set up in Hugo:
- Joseph D Heyburn: ["Who Goes Blogging 6: Three Steps to Improve Hugo's RSS Feeds"][rss-post-1]
- Ben Congdon: ["Tips for Customizing Hugo RSS Feeds"][rss-post-2]

The important pattern to recognize here is that the RSS feed can be overwritten with a new `layouts/_default/rss.xml` file. The order of RSS feed processing is `your own in layouts/_default` > `theme default` > `hugo default`.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the [RSS 2.0 spec][rss-spec] is short & straightforward to read. In the end, I made my own `xml` file which tweaked the title & description from the theme's `xml` file.

## Image optimization

In my first attempt, I placed all the images under the `static/images` directory. It turns out that placing them under `assets/images` instead makes them available for Hugo's [image processing capabilities][image-post]. At this point, the easiest way is to use Hugo shortcode to refer to them in the Markdown file. However, I preferred using the markdown native `![ ]( )` syntax.

One way to get around this is to use [Render Hooks][render-hooks]. For example, when Hugo processes the following markdown file:
```txt
# Hello World

![earth](/images/earth.png)
![sun](/images/sun.png)
```

Hugo recognizes that the file requires rendering one `Heading` and two `Image` components. For each of these types, Hugo checks the `layouts/_default/_markup` directory for user-created render hooks. In my case, I created the following in `layouts/_default/_markup/render-image.html` (note that the file name needs to match exactly as expected in the doc):

```html
{{- /* Use the render hook to make asset images available in posts */ -}}
{{- $image := resources.Get .Destination -}}
{{- if $image -}}
  {{- if strings.HasSuffix $image ".gif" -}}
    <img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" alt="{{ .Text }}"{{- with .Title }} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }} loading="lazy" />
  {{- else -}}
    {{- $optimized := $image.Process "webp q75 lanczos" -}}
    <img src="{{ $optimized.RelPermalink }}" alt="{{ .Text }}"{{- with .Title }} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }} loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
```

The top level dot `.` in this case refers to the [Render Hook Image context][image-context] which includes the `Destination` method for the image path in `assets/`. `resources.Get` returns the [image resource][resource-doc] context. It then calls the [`Process` method][process-method] to request the optimized version of an image (`"webp q75 lanczos"`). This render hook is called for each `Image` component discovered during the markdown rendering process. In the example Markdown text, it would be called twice to generate the following HTML:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<img src="/images/earth.webp" alt="earth" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
<img src="/images/sun.webp" alt="sun" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
```

Michael Welford's ["Responsive image management with Hugo"][image-blog-post] goes much beyond my basic implementation if you want to expand on it.

Using the simple image processing allowed one of my image-heavy posts to reduce total image size from 673 KB to 176 KB total, which is a 73% reduction!

## Comment system

Darek Kay wrote a [great post][hugo-comment] on the current static site comment ecosystem. I initially wanted to implement a Bluesky commenting system (like in Kaushik Gopal's [post][bluesky-post]), but realized that my readers would mostly be technical folks who already have a GitHub account. Hence, using [Giscus][giscus] which is based on GitHub Discussions seemed like a lower barrier to entry. Giscus set up took from start to end maybe 10 minutes.

I recommend reading Bryce Wray's ["Tips for using giscus"][giscus-tips] post. The point about creating a separate repo just for comment discussions was something I would have overlooked otherwise.

## Deployment

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages & deployed with GitHub Actions. I copied & pasted the YAML from the [deployment documentation][deploy-doc] and it surprisingly worked right away. The only hiccup was the extra commits to the theme git submodule I made which CI couldn't pull from, so I manually moved the theme under the `themes` directory instead & removed the git submodule.

The domain's DNS nameserver is set to Cloudflare for basic DDoS protection, TLS, bot filtering, and CDN caching. I moved from Google Analytics to a more privacy-focused [Simple Analytics][simple-analytics] to avoid setting up the cookie banner.

## Summary

Although it was certainly a bumpy ride, I'm still content with the decision to go with Hugo. It had all the features I needed and the CLI was as fast as people praised it to be. I also unexpectedly found that Hugo users seem eager to share setup blockers they encountered on their blogs! This post is my way of paying it forward.
