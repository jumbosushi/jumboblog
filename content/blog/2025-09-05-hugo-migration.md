I migrated this site from Jekyll to Hugo over the course of a week during my between-the-job funemployment.

There were couple issues with the previous version:
- It forked a Jekyll bootstrapper ([jekyll-now][jekyll-now]) which felt like an uncesesary layer of abstraction.
- The design felt cluttering, and wanted to make it simple & text focused.
- Comments were hosted on Disqus which I don't use elsewhere.

This post goes over my experience with the migration as well as what I wish I knew before starting the process.

## Understanding Hugo concepts

I found Hugo documentation quite hard to navigate. Often when starting out with a new tool, I'm looking to get an overview of how critical features are tied together. Instead, Hugo documentations is organized into dozen sections where each page have it's own `Introduction` page.

If I was to start over again, I would read Agustin Canalis's excellent [Hugo overview post][hugo-overview] as well as [this Hugo templates guide][hugo-templates] by RÃ©gis Philibert first to go beyond the "Quick start" doc.

## Design

Thankfully I found [Hugo bear blog theme][hugo-bear-theme] relatively quickly, so it was a matter of customizing the color palatte to my liking. After rolling the dice with [colors.co][colors] bunch of times, I was satisfied with this [green / orange based pallete][my-pallete]. Once I got a passing grade on [whocanuse.com][whocanuse] and checked its accessiblity, the next focus on specifc CSS issues.

### Code blocks

Besides the minor issues (e.g. inline code highlight, [iOS safari text scaling][ios-safari], etc), the biggest challenge for me was handling the code overflow. When the line went beyond the initial width of the code window, it lacked a background style.

![code_css_issue](/images/2025-09-05-hugo-migration/code_css_issue.png)

Thankfully Veriphor's ["Code block line numbers"][code-block-post] post explained how it's rendered and the solution provided worked for me.

```css
.highlight pre code {
    display: inline-block;
}

.highlight div,
.highlight > pre {
    overflow-x: auto;
}
```

For these code blocks, Hugo use the [Chroma][chroma] syntax highlighter under the hood. When a theme is referenced in `hugo.toml`, it's using the themes from Chroma. I found that not all themes are created equally. In particular, `github-dark` theme incorrectly highlited code so I went with `dracula` instead which was more accurate.

## RSS feed

Previous version relied solely on Jekyll's default RSS feed generator, but I wanted to get a better understanding of the expected format. I first read these two posts to get an overview of how it's hooked up:
- Joseph D Heyburn: ["Who Goes Blogging 6: Three Steps to Improve Hugo's RSS Feeds"][rss-post-1]
- Ben Congdon: ["Tips for Customizing Hugo RSS Feeds"][rss-post-2]

The important pattern to recognize here is that RSS feed can be overwritten with a new `layouts/_default/rss.xml` file. The order of RSS feed processing is in the order of `your own in layouts/_default` > `theme default` > `hugo default`.

Afterwards I pleasantly found out that the RSS spec is short & straightford (["RSS 2.0 Specification"][rss-spec]). Publishing my RSS feed also turned me into a RSS user (with the [Reader app][reader]) which was another unexpected outcome of this migration.

## Image optimization

In my first attempt, I placed all the images under `static/images`. However, I quickly found out that placing them under `assets/images` make it available for Hugo's [image processing capabilities][image-post]. At this point, the easiest way is to use Hugo shortcode to refer to them in the Markdown file. However, I preferred using the markdown native `![ ]( )` format.

One way to get around this is to use [Render Hooks][render-hooks]. For example, when Hugo sees the following markdown:
```txt
# Hello World

![earth][/images/earth.png]
![sun][/images/sun.png]]
```

It recognizes that the file requires rendering `Heading` and two `Image` components. For each of these types, Hugo checks `layouts/_default/_markup` directory for user created render hooks. In my case, I created the following in `layouts/_default_markup/render-image.html` (note that the file name needs to match exactly as expected in the doc):

```html
{{- /* Use the render hook to make asset images available in posts */ -}}
{{- $image := resources.Get .Destination -}}
{{- if $image -}}
  {{- if strings.HasSuffix $image ".gif" -}}
    <img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" alt="{{ .Text }}"{{- with .Title }} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }} loading="lazy" />
  {{- else -}}
    {{- $optimized := $image.Process "webp q75 lanczos" -}}
    <img src="{{ $optimized.RelPermalink }}" alt="{{ .Text }}"{{- with .Title }} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }} loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
```

The top level dot `.` in this case refers to the [Render Hook Image context][image-context] which includes the `Destination` method for the image path in `assets/`. `resources.Get` returns the [image resource][resource-doc] context. It then calls the [`Process` method][process-method] to request the optimized version (`"webp q75 lanczos"`). This render hook is called per `Image` component discovered during the markdown rendering process. In the example Markdown text, it would be called twice.

Michael Welford's ["Responsive image management with Hugo"][image-blog-post] goes much beyond my basic implementation if you want to expand on it.

Using the simple image processing allowed one of my image-heavy posts to reduce total image size from 673 KB to 176 KB total which is a 73% reduction!

## Comment system

Darek Kay wrote a [great post][hugo-comment] on the current static site comment ecosystem. I initially wanted to implement Bluesky commenting system (like in Kaushik Gopal's [post][bluesky-post]), but realized that my reader would be technical folks so using [Giscus][giscus] based on GitHub is lower barrier of entry. The whole setup took maybe 10 minutes.

I recommend reading Bryce Wray's ["Tips for using giscus"][giscus-tips] post. The point about creating separate repo just for comment discussions was something I would have overlooked overwise.

## Deployment

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages & deployed with GitHub Actions. I copied & pasted the YAML from the [deployment documentation][deploy-doc] and it surprisingly worked right away. The only hiccups was the extra commits to the theme git submodule I made which CI couldn't pull from, so I manually moved the theme under `themes` directory instead.

The domain's DNS nameserver is set to Cloudflare for basic DDoS protection, TLS, bot filtering, and CDN caching. I moved from Google Analytics to more privacy-focused [Simple Analytics][simple-analytics] to avoid setting up the cookie banner.

## Summary

Although it was certainly a bumpy ride, I'm still content with the decision to go with Hugo. It had all the features I needed (e.g. Image Processing) and CLI was as fast as people raved about. I also unexpectedly found that Hugo users seem to be eager to share what they learned on their blogs! This post is my way of paying it forward.
